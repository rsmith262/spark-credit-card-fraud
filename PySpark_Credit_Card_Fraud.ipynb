    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit card fraud increased by 10 percent from 2020 - 2021 and an estimated loss of over 30 Billion dollars [[1]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1394119/global-card-fraud-losses/). The convenience of debit and credit cards has pushed cash payments into second place in consumer preference. A study in 2021 showed that 57% of payments in the UK were done via card payment with 32% of payments being contactless [[2]](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-08/UKF%20Payment%20Markets%20Summary%202022.pdf). Credit card fraud occurs when unauthorised access is gained to an individuals card to make purchases or other transactions [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud). In 2021 it was identified as the second most common form of identity theft with 389,845 complaints [[4]](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/identity-theft-statistics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these alarming statistics and the magnitude of losses being incurred by credit card companies and merchants, there is an ever increasing need to be able to identify fraudulent transactions and stop them before they can go through. Historically, rule based fraud detection has been used, this took a pre programmed set of rules and used these to identify changes in behaviour that could be a sign of credit card fraud [[5]](https://fraud.net/d/rules-based-fraud-detection/). Due to the increases and variety of transactions and the increased sophistication of fraudsters these historic identity systems are no longer viable and in recent years machine learning and AI has increasingly been used in the fight against credit card fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud detection presents itself as a binary classification problem. Machine learning is used in credit card fraud detection by taking transactional datapoints and training models to detect the patterns in the data that can be used to identify fraudulent transactions. Generally supervised methods are used that train models on labelled datasets. These models can then be used on new unseen data to predict whether the transaction is real or fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this coursework I will analysis a credit card fraud data set to find a model suitable for fraud detection. This is a relevant subject to use due to the harm and financial damage it causes on both a personal level for victims and the wider global impact it has for companies and financial markets. This topic is suitable for this module as credit card fraud is a big data problem. Training the models involve a huge amount of data that will need to be analysed using big data methodologies such as parallel processing frameworks and distributed computing clusters. Due to the complexity of the subject, these models will need continuous tuning so the algorithms stay performing well on new data. The methodologies used in real time detection is also a big data problem with both the model training and real time fraud prediction both involving huge amounts of data and conforming to the typical 5 V's of big data [[6]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/5-Vs-of-big-data)"

    "### Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set I have used for my analysis comes from Kaggle and is called 'Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset' [[7]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection). It is a simulated data set of credit card transactions for 1000 customers with all transactions taking place over the duration of 2019. On Kaggle the data set is split into a train and test data set, however for my analysis I have combined these whilst exploring and creating new features. \n",
    "\n",
    "In total the combined data set has 1,852,394 records and is c500mb in total. And although this is not particular big in the sense of big data my analysis and transformations will all be done using spark and big data methodologies that could be used on much larger data sets. From exploring the data in my EDA below, I found there are 10 numerical columns and 12 categorical. There are no nulls in the data set to deal with or duplicate records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting fraud presents and binary classification problem and due to the nature of fraud analysis the data set is highly imbalanced. There are 9,651 fraudulent records and 1,842,743 records labelled as not fraud. This means only 0.52% of the data is the fraud class. This brings a set of challenges to the modelling as training a model on imbalanced records can cause it to be biased towards the majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "From my initial exploration the 'amt' column stands out as being one to explore - this is the transactional amount. The amounts are highly variable which is seen due to the standard deviation being much higher than the mean. The majority of the transactions are low with larger outliers causing the mean to be significantly higher than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from this shows the median is lower than the mean because of high value outliers. It shows that 25% of the transactions are lower than or equal to 9.65 which shows a very large number of transactions are small. And 75% of the transactions are lower or equal to 83.09. My takeaway from this is the amount is highly variable and right skewed with the majority of the transactions being relatively low but a few high value transactions that push up the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something I will be investigating later in conjunction with target variable as I would hypothesise the fraud transactions are likely to be smaller in value as high value transactions are more likely to be scrutinised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age is another variable I would like to explore further as part of my initial research into the subject suggests certain age groups are more susceptible to fraud. With the 30-39 age group being most likely [[8]](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/credit-card-fraud-statistics/#fraud),"

    "\n",
    "Forming part of my analysis I will be running a number of empirical tasks and testing hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an effective model I will need to apply sampling methods to balance out the datasets. I propose to test models where I have oversampled the data set and undersampled. Oversampling keeps all of the majority class and replicates records from the minority class to create a balanced data set. This prevents data loss because all original records are kept, however it does introduce bias as the minority records are repeated multiple times. Undersampling is the opposite and is done by deleting enough of the majority class to balance the data set that way, this though will cause a large amount of valuable data to be lost. I hypothesise that oversampling will produce better results as there will be a noteable amount more data to train the model with.\n",

    "2. Testing different models\n",
    "\n",
    "I propose to test 3 different models to see which performs best:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression\n",
    "* Naive Bayes\n",
    "* Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesise the best results will be achieved via a Random Forest model. The random forest algorithm is an ensemble method that uses bootstrapping methodology and creates multiple decision trees from the data and the averages the results to produce powerful predictions [[9]](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-classification-678e551462f5). A benchmarking study in 2019 found that Random Forests performed better than logistic regression on 69% of the data sets tested [[10]](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2264-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross Validation and Gridsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "I propose to use cross validation (CV) as part of the training pipeline. CV splits the data into k-folds so you can effecitvely use all the training data to train and test the models. This helps it to prevent overfitting and means the algorithms should generalise to new data more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside CV I will use gridsearch to find the optimal hyperparameters to be used to train the final model. Gridsearch takes a given grid of hyperparameters and iterates through them performing CV on each combination. It then evaluates each model and gives the best set of hyperparameters as its final best model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After I've output the best model this will be used on the hold out test set to predict the target class. I will evaluate it's performance using a number of metrics. Due to the data being imbalanced certain methods such as accuracy will be misleading as you could predict all labels as not fraud and still get a 99.5% accuracy score. Evaluation methods such as AUC-ROC and AUC-PR will give a better sense of model performance."

    "The results show the best model was the Random Forest classifier trained on the oversampled data set. I used the following metrics for evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AUC-ROC: 0.9954\n",
    "* AUC-PR: 0.8188\n",
    "* Accuracy: 0.9928\n",
    "* Precision: 0.9963\n",
    "* Recall: 0.9928\n",
    "* F1 Score: 0.9941\n",
    "\n",
    "Often accuracy is the main benchmark used in analysing the performance of models. However, this can be misleading, especially in the case of imbalanced data sets. With this set in particular the majority class (class 0) is c99.5% of the data so predicting all as class 0 would give a model accuracy of 99.5%, but obviously this would not be a good model as no fraud would be caught. Therefore, other metrics give a better picture of the actual effectiveness of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision, recall and F1 score are all >99% which suggests the model performs well in these areas. Precision relates to the instances of correctly predicted positive class and recall relates to haw many of the actual positives were correctly predicted. A high score like this shows there were low rates of false positives and false negatives. In fraud prediction generally you would be more concerned with minimising false negatives i.e. not catching fraudulent transactions. The F1 score is the harmonic mean between precision and recall. The score of my model suggests this is doing well in relation to these metrics[[32]](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/metrics-to-evaluate-your-classification-model-to-take-the-right-decisions).\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics can sometimes also be misleading especially when it comes to imbalanced data, so I've also used AUC-ROC and AUC-PR. AUC-ROC looks at the false positive rate and true positive rate a number closer to 1 suggests the model is able to distinguish well between the positive and negative class. AUC-PR is good for evaluating imbalanced data as it focuses more on the performance in relation to the positive minority class - my model score of 0.82 suggests the model could improve in this area and fails to predict the minority (fraud) class in some instances [[33]](https://medium.com/alliedoffsets/boost-your-binary-classification-game-auc-roc-vs-auc-pr-which-one-should-you-use-28f6518d7bda).\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression for this problem. This wasn't a surprise as RF is a powerful method that often proves to outperform other models. The oversampled data set also proved to be the best to train the model although not by that far and not by too much, the undersampled RF model was the next best with the AUC-PR for the undersampled model being 0.76. The benchmarked model where the training set was not sampled at all was 0.59 for AUC-PR, this is interesting as it outperforms both Logistic Regression models using the sampled data by a considerable amount. The AUC-PR for the best Logistic Regression model (undersampled) was 0.22.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oversampling although performing best here, has a tendency to overfit because the minority class records are replicated which is likely to have caused the lower AUC-PR. It would have been interesting to also try SMOTE to see if this would get better results. Using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, rather than replicating the minority class, it uses statistical methods to synthetically create new unique minority records to balance the data and often proves to get good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining the feature importance results from the best random forest model gave good insights into which features created a good model. The top features by far were the transaction amount and the time features with age and category following. These were also highlighted when I looked at the correlation between features and the target class before I put the pipeline together. It would be interesting to see if reducing the features thus reducing the noise in the data might get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and further work\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest obstacles with this project was the compute time. Because I was using grid search cross validation each model was doing multiple fits and causing the run time to be really long. I initially wanted to test more than two models, but it proved to be taking too much time to run to be realistic. I was hoping to try Support Vector Machines as another model to validate. And also, XGBoost as that tends to get better results than Random Forests but that seemed to require installation on the Lena cluster as it isn't included in Spark MLlib. Using the heavily reduced sample set I've provided with the submission helped with testing but due to the nature of the dataset it didn't work using the sample to get results as they were very different to the full set. I would also have liked to increase the k-folds of the cross validation to at least 5 folds and tuned more parameters within the gridsearch but again this makes it even more compute time expensive as it increases the number of fits needed. I also struggled with the speeds on the Lena cluster. It was often really slow or would completely crash which caused some frustration when I was trying to run the project, it would be good to try this project using a cloud service to see if this reduced the run times. If I was to do this again it would be interesting to try reducing the features down further to try and get better results as the correlation and feature importance suggested this could be the case. Finally, I was hoping to use a confusion matrix as part of the evaluation however, I ran out of time, and it seemed more convoluted than using SKlearn where it's very straightforward. I was reluctant to use anything outside of Pyspark for coding and analysis as the project requirements were to use Pyspark, which was not something I had used before starting this module."
